=System Requirements for Gibberizer=

Gibberizer requires:

    * Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 (ake JRE 1.5) or later.  If you don't have this intalled on your computer, you can [http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp download the latest JRE] from Sun Microsystems. If you have an earlier version of the JRE, Gibberizer might work. Or it may destroy Western Civilization. I haven't tested for that.
    * A modicum of goofiness in the user. I'm confident that you're goofy enough. SRSLY KTHXBAI.
