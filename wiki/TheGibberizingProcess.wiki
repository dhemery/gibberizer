=The Gibberizing Process=

Gibberizer translates your text into [Gib 'lexically-similar' gibs] in four steps:

*Step 1:* [SlicingTextIntoStrings Slice the input text] into one or more strings.

*Step 2:* [ParsingNgrams Parse each string] into a set of [NGram N-grams], and make a list of all N-grams from all strings.  Notes which N-grams [StartingAndEndingNgrams start and end] each string.

*Step 3:* [CombiningNgramsIntoGibs Create gibs] from the list of N-grams.  Throw out any gibs that are [FilteringGibs disallowed by the filters].  Continue until all of the gibs you wanted have been created, or until [GivingUp too many failures occur].

*Step 4:* Display the list of created gibs, separating them with spaces, new lines, or blank lines as you directed.
