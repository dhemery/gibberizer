#summary What's going on inside Gibberizer.

= The Overall Process =

Gibberizer translates your text into [Gib 'lexically-similar' gibs] using this process:

*Step 1:* Gibberizer [SlicingTextIntoStrings slices your input text] into one or more strings.

*Step 2:* Gibberizer [ParsingNgrams parses each string] into a set of [NGram N-grams], and makes a list of all N-grams from all strings.  It notes which N-grams [StartingAndEndingNgrams start and end] each string.

*Step 3:* Gibberizer [CombiningNgramsIntoGibs creates gibs] from the list of N-grams.  It throws out any gibs that are [FilteringGibs disallowed by the filters].  It continues until it can deliver all of the gibs you wanted, or until it [GivingUp gives up in despair].

*Step 4:* Gibberizer displays the list of gibs it created, separating them with spaces, new lines, or blank lines as you directed.
